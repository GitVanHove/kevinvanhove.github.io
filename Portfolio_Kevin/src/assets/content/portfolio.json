        "It all started as a simple idea: making my own banner. But, as things often go, it spiraled into a little side project of AI-generated art. :p",
        "I wanted to make my own content using free software (I'm cheap) cause it can be hard to find especially with me in it, i don't like pictures nor can i make them. What started as a quick experiment turned into a fun journey of prompt engineering, fine-tuning styles, and occasionally battling AI-generated hands that looked... well, cursed.",
        "Running into ComfyUI with it's complex node system and stable diffusion i was given that option. There where easier tools to use like Automatic1111 but my ego forced me to use the hard one."

        "For this project, I used Stable Diffusion with ComfyUI as i mentioned, diving deep into prompt crafting, model selection from Civitai (Dodging NSFW content like a pro), and creating my own workflows using ComfyUI's complex node system.",
        "What I learned: AI art is fun, unpredictable, and surprisingly addictive (It's like a slot machine, i kept pressing that button wondering what would come out). It also reinforced that programming isn't just about logic—it’s about creativity, experimentation, and using 2000+ years of technical evolution to render a cat and goose playing cards or hot woman.",
        "In the end, I got more than just a banner—I got a deeper appreciation for AI-generated art and a cool fun new hobby. Would I do it again? Absolutely! Will i go bankrupt buying myself a better GPU, unfortunatly, probably and eventually.... yes :(."
